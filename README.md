# js disabler

A small tool I made that disables JavaScript on HTML pages so I can pass through paywalls.

For this I used [pupeteer](https://pptr.dev) and  [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars).

### To run locally

##### 1. Clone the repository and get inside the folder
```bash session
    git clone https://github.com/barbarabrito/js-disabler.git
```

```bash session
    cd js-disabler
```

##### 2. Install the dependencies

```bash session
    npm install
```

```bash session
    npm run dev
```
